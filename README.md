# Technical Documentation

## Description

This is a clean interface I designed and built to showcase technical documentation using simple but effective HTML5 and CSS3. The site is fully accessible and is responsive across all devices.

## Getting Started

I commented throughout the files, but let me know if you have any questions. To view this project live on GitHub Pages, please visit [this link](https://jamie-ev.github.io/Technical_Documentation/). Thanks for dropping by!
